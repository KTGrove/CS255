#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was presented to us by Liam, someone who aimed to improve the passing rate of student drivers. His goal was to offer packages to people who were new to driving to aid them in the learning process.
Practice tests, courses, and guided drive time were all offered by DriverPass. Liam wanted us to design a program in which people could create their own personal user accounts and sign up for these packages online.
He also wanted us to ensure that customer users of the program could access it from anywhere and learn on their time by taking practice tests when most convenient for them.

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did well with creating the necessary diagrams for this project. Creating a visual aid that allowed not only myself but others to view the project from a non-technical angle was very useful, and more fun
than I expected. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If could pick one part to revise it would be my differentiating between technical and non-technical requirements. Sometimes I think more from the angle of a user rather than a developer and it makes it difficult
for me to differentiate what is actually necessary to run the program. As a user I may see some things as technically necessary but really they aren't.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implimented the user's needs by ensuring their was secure access, ease of use, and routes for users to take in the case they did need help with the system. It's important to conisder the user's needs
when designing anything because they are the ones who will be utilizing the system most. The more the system can be created around what they need the less often there will need to be updates or changes 
made to the system down the road. 

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
How I would normally approach designing software before was mostly by creating psuedocode, however now that I have learned more about diagrams and their importance I will be more likely to use a 
combination of diagrams and psuedocode to better plan and layout the project at hand.
